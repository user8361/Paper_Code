Kinetics 
( Kinetics-400 contains ∼300k
  video clips with 400 human action categories. )

contains 400 categories and provides download
URL links for ∼240k training videos and ∼20k validation
videos. In our experiments, we successfully collect 223,127
training videos and 18,153 validation videos, because a
small fraction of the URLs (around 10%) is no longer valid.
For the Kinetics dataset, the methods are learned on the
training set and evaluated on the validation set. 

HMDB
contains 51 classes and 6,766 videos,
while UCF includes
101 categories with 13,320 videos. For these two datasets,
we follow TSN [44] to utilize three different training/testing
splits for evaluation, and the average results are reported.

Something-Something V1 
includes 174 categories 
with 86,017 training videos, 11,522 validation videos, and
10,960 test videos. total 108499 videos

Something-Something V2
includes 174 categoories
contains ~169k videos clips in training set and ~25k videos clip in validation set

All of them have been split into
individual frames at the same rate, and the extracted frames
are also publicly available. The methods are learned on the
training set and measured on the validation set and test set.
